# DistanceCalc

Approach for the Distance Calculator Assignment

As a sohpomore software engineering student, my capabilities in the areas of Java, HTML, and CSS are limited as to my lack of prior knowledge and experience with said coding languages. In order to approach this in a efficent and proper manner I will break it down into smaller steps and focus on understanding the core concepts of the languages involved.

1. Research: I will spend some time researching the basics of Java web development, HTTP, and CSS in order to incorperate them into the program and meet assignment standards.
2. Set up a development environment: I will set up a local development environment with Java in VSC and a web server to test my code.
3. Learn Java Basics: Since Java is very similar to C++ it will not be hard to grasp fundamental concepts to allow me to implement the logic and syntax behind the calculator. I will familarize myself with Java syntax and learn about classes, objects, and basic object-oriented programming concepts for Java.
4. Learn HTML and CSS basics: I will learn the basics of HTML to create the structure and elements of the web interface. If time permits I will also learn to understand CSS to style the HTML elements and create an appealing layout for testers and users alike.
5. Implement the backend logic: Implement logic to convert the distances and calculate the total distance. Convert the total distance back to the desiered output unit. Prepare the response to display the calculated distance in the unit selected by the user.
6. Create HTML website: Create an HTML form with appropriate input fields and a submit button.
7. Test and Debug: Test the application locally by running the server and accessing the web page in a browser. Verify that the form submission triggers the correct URL and the distance calculation is performed accurately.
8. Documentation and code organization: Add comments to code to indicate the purpose and functionality of each code. Use meaningful variables and method names to make code easier to read
